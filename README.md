<h2>Pangong issues</h2>
<b>New Delhi:</b> Specialised elements of the <b><i>Indian Army</i></b> outflanked China’s People’s Liberation Army on the night of 29 August,
dominating at least four locations claimed by both sides near the southern bank of the Pangong Tso.The action drew a sharp 
verbal reaction from the Chinese military, with the Western Theatre Command of the PLA, which oversees borders with <b><i>India</i></b>, 
issuing a statement accusing the <b><i>Indian Army</i></b> of violating the consensus reached at the multi-level talks between both countries.
The remarks by the PLA came hours after the <b><i>Indian Army </i></b>issued a statement, saying that on the night of 29 August, PLA troops 
violated the agreed consensus, and carried out provocative military movements to change the status quo.It said <b><i>Indian troops </i></b>
pre-empted PLA activity on the southern bank of Pangong Tso, undertook measures to strengthen positions and <b><i>“thwart Chinese 
intentions to unilaterally change facts on ground”</i></b>, adding that the <b><i>Indian Army</i></b> is committed to maintaining peace and tranquillity 
through dialogue, but is also equally determined to protect its territorial integrity.
